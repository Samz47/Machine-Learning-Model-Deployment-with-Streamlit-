## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data exploration to model deployment. It includes:

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of wine quality dataset
- **Model Training**: Multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) with cross-validation
- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit application with data exploration, visualizations, and predictions
- **Cloud Deployment**: Ready for deployment on Streamlit Cloud

The model predicts whether a wine is of **good quality** (quality score ≥ 7) or **poor quality** (quality score < 7) based on various physicochemical properties.

### Download Instructions

1. Visit the [Kaggle dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)
2. Download the dataset (CSV file)
3. Place the CSV file in the `data/` directory as `winequality.csv`
4. Alternatively, you can use the UCI Wine Quality dataset which is publicly available

**Note**: If you don't have the dataset, the app will still work but some features may be limited. The model files (`model.pkl`, etc.) should be generated by running the training notebook first.
